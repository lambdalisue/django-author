Update author and updated_by fields of models automatically

This library is used for updating ``author`` and ``updated_by`` fields automatically
with ``request.user`` when the model has created/changed.

Also if you are too lazy to write ``author = models.ForeignKey(User, _('author'), related_name ...)`` to every model,
just add ``@with_author`` decorator to the top of class makes you happy.


Install
==============
This library is on PyPI so you can install it with::

    pip install django-author

or from github::
    
    pip install git+https://github.com/lambdalisue/django-author.git


Usage
==========

1.  Add ``'author'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` on settings.py

2.  Add ``'author.middlewares.AuthorDefaultBackendMiddleware'`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
    if you use default author backend

3.  Add ``author`` and ``updated_by`` field to models which you want to have ``author`` and ``updated_by`` fields manually
    or use ``@with_author`` decorator like below::

        from django.db import models
        from author.decorators import with_author

        @with_author
        class Entry(models.Model):
            title = models.CharField('title', max_length=50)
            body = models.TextField('body')

4.  Done. Now you have automatically updated ``author`` and ``updated_by`` fields

    If you are in truble, see ``author_test`` directory for usage sample.
